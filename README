NAME
    AnyEvent::SerialPort - AnyEvent::Handle subclass for serial ports

VERSION
    version 1.130170

SYNOPSIS
      use AnyEvent;
      use AnyEvent::SerialPort;

      my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;

      my $hdl;
      $hdl = AnyEvent::SerialPort->new(
               serial_port => '/dev/ttyUSB0',
               # other AnyEvent::Handle arguments here
             );

      # or to use something other than 9600 8n1 raw
      $hdl = AnyEvent::SerialPort->new
              (
               serial_port =>
                 [ '/dev/ttyUSB0',
                   [ baudrate => 4800 ],
                   # other [ "Device::SerialPort setter name" => \@arguments ] here
                 ],
               # other AnyEvent::Handle arguments here
             );

      # obtain the Device::SerialPort object
      my $port = $hdl->serial_port;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of AnyEvent::Handle for serial ports.

    IMPORTANT: This is a new API and is still subject to change. Feedback
    and suggestions would be very welcome.

METHODS
  new(%parameters)
    Constructs an AnyEvent::SerialPort object based on the given parameters.
    The permitted parameters are those of the AnyEvent::Handle super class
    constructor (except "connect" and "fh" which would not make sense) and a
    "serial_port" parameter. The value of the serial port parameter may be
    either:

    *   the full path name of the serial device, or

    *   a list reference containing the full path name of the serial device
        and zero or more list references each containing a
        Device::SerialPort method name and arguments to be executed on the
        wrapped Device::SerialPort object.

    By default, the following setter methods are called on the underlying
    Device::SerialPort object:

    baudrate(9600),
    databits(8),
    parity('none'),
    stopbits(1), and
    datatype('raw')

    The second form of the "serial_port" parameter value described above can
    be used to override these settings and apply additional setters.

    See the "SYNOPSIS" for examples.

  serial_port()
    Return the wrapped Device::SerialPort object.
